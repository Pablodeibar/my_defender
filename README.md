The goal of this project is to create a Tower Defense on the theme of our choice we were 2 for this project


## Description ðŸ“œ

Your game must follow the following rules:
- The player is a builder who must defend his castle.
- Enemy waves will regularly appear from one side of the playground.
- The player must buy and place buildings on the playground grid to block/kill enemies.
- Buildings can be offensive (towers attacking) or defensive (basic walls).
- When the castle is reached by an enemy, it takes damages.
- If the castle reaches 0 hit points the player loose.

During this project we only had the right to some functions here

We made a scene system for menus, inventories, gameplay etc.
Then we created an intuitive menu with buttons that have corresponding hitboxes.
There was a button to start the game, one to close it and a last one which explained how to play and the mechanics.

The how to play button has an image that explain how to buy soldiers, how much they cost, what are their attacks.

Once you want to play, you press the play button and the game start. Each character has its own characteristics. Racoons are faster, birds hit harder, skeletons are the both at the same time and the ball of fire one shoot all the ennemies.

Each time you kill an enemy you earn money, but you also earn money every second. Your coins appear at the top left of the screen. You will also find the remaining number of hearts of your castle there.
